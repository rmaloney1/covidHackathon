hackathon notes

The problem is we are trying to maximise productivity in limited physical office space during covid restrictions

points:
	training and learning is much better in person
	various work tasks which require collaboration are done better in person
		devs:
			sprint planning
			client discussions
			frontend mockups and design ideas
		mangers:
			strategy planning
				especially in covid
		non-dev roles:
			engineers, lab workers
			less technologically experienced 
	alternatives:
		outlook: books rooms and stuff
			no automatic prioritisation
			only booking rooms: not general work area
		service desk: literally just book meeting rooms
			same limits as outlook
	post covid:
		making more efficient use of limited space for larger teams
			real estate is expensive: especially in CBDs
